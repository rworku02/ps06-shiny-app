My data is on homelessness in Seattle/King County. The data was collected between 1998-2020, and
can be sorted into different categories such as demographics, region, or cause. My second tab is the Plots tab that displays a barplot of the causes of homelessness in the data, and had a widget to change the color of the bars, and another widget that changes the data being displayed. My third tab is the Table tab that shows a table of data. There is a widget that allows the user to select a certain demographic to view.
